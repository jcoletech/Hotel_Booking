# HOTEL BOOKING ANALYSIS
# INTRODUCTION
In the initial stages of conducting a comprehensive hotel booking analysis, I employed a strategic blend of Excel, SQL, and Power BI tools. These tools collectively facilitated the transformation of raw booking data into actionable insights. Excel enabled data cleaning and organization, SQL streamlined data storage and retrieval, while Power BI facilitated the creation of interactive visualizations to showcase key booking trends and patterns, laying the foundation for a data-driven exploration of the hospitality industry's booking landscape.
The dataset comprises 119,390 entries corresponding to reservations made at both a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel. Each entry represents a booking occurrence spanning from July 1, 2015, to August 31, 2017, encompassing both fulfilled reservations and those that were canceled.

# DATA COLLECTION

I acquired the hotel booking dataset from the Kaggle website. I proceeded to extract the data from the zipped archive file and stored it on my drive was in form of a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file.

# DATA PROCESSING (EXCEL)
In this step, it was essential to thoroughly review and process the dataset's content. To accomplish this, I imported the CSV file of the dataset into Microsoft Excel. The dataset comprised 34 columns and a total of 119,390 rows.

# DATA ANALYSIS (MY SQL)
I utilized the table data import wizard within MySQL Workbench to load both datasets onto the MySQL server. Once this step was finished, I examined the tables. Following that, I conducted exploratory data analysis on the dataset to uncover notable observations. first, I identified essential performance metrics using subqueries. Upon completion of the process, I scrutinized the comprehensive booking records for both hotels, differentiating between reservations that were canceled and those that were not. Subsequently, I proceeded to determine the types of customers linked to bookings that were either canceled or not canceled for both hotels. Following that, I identified the distribution channels corresponding to the hotels, distinguishing between reservations that were canceled and those that were not. I replicated the procedure to examine the trends in hotel occupancy on both a monthly and yearly scale for both hotels, I determined the top ten weekdays that customers frequently select for their overnight stays at the hotel. I also identified the ten weekdays most commonly chosen by customers for their overnight stays at the hotel, excluding cases where their reservations were canceled, I also investigated the countries of origin for the top 10 guests. Next, I analyzed the reservation statuses of customers who upheld their bookings without undergoing any cancellations. Following that, I conducted an analysis to identify the market segments present among customers who maintained their bookings without any cancellations. Subsequent to that, I carried out an examination to determine the count of customers whose allocated rooms aligned with their reserved room types and whose bookings remained unaffected by cancellations.

# DATA PROCESS (POWER BI)
Once I imported the data into Power BI, I swiftly initiated exploratory data analysis by utilizing DAX formulas to calculate the overall count of customers who visited the hotel within the specified timeframe. Next i used another DAX Formula in Power BI to create another new measure to Substituted '1' with 'is canceled' and '0' with 'canceled'. 

# DATA DRIVEN INSIGHT (POWER BI)
During this phase, the objective was to generate visual representations to extract meaningful observations from the data, shedding light on the booking performance of both the city and resort hotels. Furthermore, additional insights were revealed as follows:
- The initial visualization, I utilized multi-card visuals to present information on various aspects, including the overall number of customer bookings, the average daily rate, instances of special requests, recurring guests, the count of children, babies, and adults, the total customer count, room types, and meal types within the hotel.
- The most prominent customer type was Transient, comprising 75% of all customer types, followed by Transient Party, Contract, and Group. The customer counts varied within this set, ranging from 577 to 89,613, with Transient holding the highest count and Group the lowest.
- Regarding the hotels, the City Hotel had 79,330 bookings, surpassing the Resort Hotel's count of 40,060. City Hotel represented 66.45% of the total hotel count, while Resort Hotel accounted for the remaining.
- Bookings that were not canceled had a higher total count of deposit types (75,166) in comparison to canceled bookings (44,224). "No Deposit" type constituted the majority at 62.77% of the overall deposit type count.
- Over the period from July 2015 to August 2017, both City Hotel (with a growth of 123.53%) and Resort Hotel (with a growth of 30.62%) observed an increase in the count of hotels. For Resort Hotel, this rise began in April 2017, leading to a 3.33% increase (58 hotels) in just 4 months.
- The majority of guests tend to stay in the hotel for durations of 2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 10, and 8 days. These durations account for the predominant choices when guests visit the hotel, encompassing over 60% of guest stays.
- Portugal accounted for the highest number of guests, followed by the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Belgium, Brazil, and Netherlands . These top 10 countries collectively contribute to more than 70% of the total guest.
- The highest count of hotels was observed in the "Check-Out" category with 75,166, followed by "Canceled" with 43,017 and "No-Show" with 1,207. The "Check-Out" category constituted the majority at 62.96% of the overall hotel count.
- In terms of market segments, the "Online TA" segment held the largest share at 47%, trailed by "Offline TA/TO" at 20%. The "Groups" segment accounted for 17%, while the "Direct" market segment represented 11%. The remaining market segments, namely "Corporate," "Complementary," "Aviation," and "Undefined," followed consecutively with lower percentages.

# CONCLUSION 
In conclusion, the comprehensive hotel booking analysis revealed valuable insights into customer behaviors, hotel performance, and market segments. Notably, the majority of guests preferred shorter stays, with durations of 1 to 6 days being the most popular choices. The analysis also highlighted the prominence of certain countries, such as Portugal, the United Kingdom, and France, as major sources of guests, contributing to over 70% of the total guest count. Moreover, the "Check-Out" category dominated the hotel count, signifying a significant proportion of completed stays. In terms of market segments, the "Online TA" category emerged as the leading segment, indicating the prevalence of online travel agencies in driving bookings. These insights collectively provide a deeper understanding of booking trends, guest preferences, and market dynamics, enabling hotel management to make informed decisions for enhancing customer experiences and optimizing operations.
